# TownyPersistentToggle

TownyPersistentToggle is a Minecraft plugin built on the Paper API that preserves the state of Towny resident modes and HUDs across player logins and server restarts.

This plugin supports all resident modes (accessed via `/res toggle [mode]`), Towny's map HUD (`/towny map hud`) and Towny's plot permission HUD (`/plot perm hud`).

*Note: This plugin is developed and tested against the latest version of Paper. While it may work on Paper forks or older versions, they are not actively tested or supported.*
